# Usage: mydelta [bash command]
# The "mydelta" script is a wrapper around any arbitrary bash command. Each time
# you run a bash command via "mydelta", the command will be run and you will be
# shown a diff of the previous "mydelta" run and the current "mydelta" run.

# Example:
# $ mydelta ifconfig
# $ mydelta ls -la

DELTA_PATH=/tmp/mydelta
NEW_FILE=$DELTA_PATH/mydelta_new.txt
OLD_FILE=$DELTA_PATH/mydelta_old.txt
#DIFF_CMD='mydiff'
#DIFF_CMD='diffuse'
#DIFF_CMD='diff -y'
DIFF_CMD='meld'

mkdir -p $DELTA_PATH # setup for first run

$@ > $NEW_FILE

if [ -w $OLD_FILE ]; then
    $DIFF_CMD $OLD_FILE $NEW_FILE

    echo This is the first run of $0. No results to diff against.
